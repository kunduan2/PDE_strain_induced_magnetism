# PDE_strain_induced_magnetism

This project investigates how strain influences the emergence of magnetic moments in quantum materials. The underlying physics is modeled through an energy minimization framework, resulting in a set of coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). We solve these equations numerically using the finite difference method (FDM), enabling simulation of the strain-induced magnetization dynamics across a discretized grid.
